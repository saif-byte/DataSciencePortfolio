# DataSciencePortfolio
**Hello Everyone!** 
This is my DataScience portfolio. I keep including my portfolio projects here. 

## Machine Learning:
[Steel Industry load classification](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Steel%20Industry%20Load%20Classification/load_type_classifier.ipynb): A model to predict load type using various feature such as kwh usage and current power factor. 

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn , Seaborn, Matplotlib , Flask_,

[Defaulter or not](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Credit%20Risk%20Scoring/Credit_Risk_Scoring.ipynb): A model to predict whether the customer of a bank is going to get default. Banks and other financial institution can use this model to predict if the customer should be given more credit or the customer will be going to default.

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn , Seaborn, Matplotlib , Flask_, 

[Will the customer churn or not?](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Churn%20Prediction/Churn_or_not_Churn.ipynb): A model to predict whether the customer will continue with our service or not. This model can be used to know before hand if the customer is about to stop using our services. then we can offer promotional discounts and emails to sustain these customers. Serve the learned model to web using Flask.

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn , Flask , Seaborn, Matplotlib_

[Predicting total orders on a given day](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Total%20Order%20predictor/Predicting_total_orders_on_a_given_day.ipynb) : A model to predict total number of orders that can be treated in a day. This model can be used to evaluate performance of employees by predicting number of orders that can be delievered. 

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn , Seaborn, Matplotlib_

[Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/CarPricePrediction/Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb) : A model to predict prices of a car using linear regression model. This can be used in predicting prices of cars listed in car selling $ buying websites. Identified key attributes that effect the prices of cars.

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

## Web Scraping:
[Blog Information Scraper](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Web%20Scraping/Harvard%20Health%20Blog%20Website/HarvardHealthBlogScraper.ipynb): A python script to scrape all the information such as headline, summary, category , link and date published of all articles from a health blog website.

_Tools used : BeautifulSoup_
