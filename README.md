# DataSciencePortfolio
**Hello Everyone!** 
This is my DataScience portfolio. I keep including my portfolio projects here. 

## Machine Learning
[Predicting total orders on a given day](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/Total%20Order%20predictor/Predicting_total_orders_on_a_given_day.ipynb) : A model to predict total number of orders that can be treated in a day. This model can be used to evaluate performance of employees by predicting number of orders that can be delievered. 

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Scikit learn , Seaborn, Matplotlib_

[Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/saif-byte/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/CarPricePrediction/Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb) : A model to predict prices of a car using linear regression model. This can be used in predicting prices of cars listed in car selling $ buying websites. Identified key attributes that effect the prices of cars.

_Tools used : Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_
